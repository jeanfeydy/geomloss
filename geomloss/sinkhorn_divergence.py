    This is the main "core" routine of GeomLoss. It is written to
    solve optimal transport problems efficiently in all the settings
    that are supported by the library: (generalized) point clouds,
    images and volumes.

    This algorithm is described in Section 3.3.3 of Jean Feydy's PhD thesis,
    "Geometric data analysis, beyond convolutions" (Universite Paris-Saclay, 2020)
    (https://www.jeanfeydy.com/geometric_data_analysis.pdf).
    Algorithm 3.5 corresponds to the case where `kernel_truncation` is None,
    while Algorithm 3.6 describes the full multiscale algorithm.

    Args:
        softmin (function): This routine must implement the (soft-)C-transform
            between dual vectors, which is the core computation for
            Auction- and Sinkhorn-like optimal transport solvers.
            If `eps` is a float number, `C_xy` encodes a cost matrix :math:`C(x_i,y_j)`
            and `g` encodes a dual potential :math:`g_j` that is supported by the points
            :math:`y_j`'s, then `softmin(eps, C_xy, g)` must return a dual potential
            `f` for ":math:`f_i`", supported by the :math:`x_i`'s, that is equal to:

            .. math::

                \big[ g_j - C(x_i, y_j) / \varepsilon \big]~.

            For more detail, see e.g. Section 3.3 and Eq. (3.186) in Jean Feydy's PhD thesis.

        a_logs (list of Tensors): List of log-weights :math:`\log(\alpha_i)`
            for the first input measure at different resolutions.

        b_logs (list of Tensors): List of log-weights :math:`\log(\beta_i)`
            for the second input measure at different resolutions.

        C_xxs (list): List of objects that encode the cost matrices
            :math:`C(x_i, x_j)` between the samples of the first input
            measure at different scales.
            These will be passed to the `softmin` function as second arguments.

        C_yys (list): List of objects that encode the cost matrices
            :math:`C(y_i, y_j)` between the samples of the second input
            measure at different scales.
            These will be passed to the `softmin` function as second arguments.

        C_xys (list): List of objects that encode the cost matrices
            :math:`C(x_i, y_j)` between the samples of the first and second input
            measures at different scales.
            These will be passed to the `softmin` function as second arguments.

        C_yxs (list): List of objects that encode the cost matrices
            :math:`C(y_i, x_j)` between the samples of the second and first input
            measures at different scales.
            These will be passed to the `softmin` function as second arguments.

        eps_list (list of float): List of successive values for the temperature
            :math:`\varepsilon`. The number of iterations in the loop
            is equal to the length of this list.

        rho (float or None): Strength of the marginal constraints for unbalanced OT.
            None stands for :math:`\rho = +\infty`, i.e. balanced OT.

        jumps (list, optional): List of iteration numbers where we "jump"
            from a coarse resolution to a finer one by looking
            one step further in the lists `a_logs`, `b_logs`, `C_xxs`, etc.
            Count starts at iteration 0.
            Defaults to [] - single-scale mode without jumps.

        kernel_truncation (function, optional): Implements the kernel truncation trick.
            Defaults to None.

        truncate (int, optional): Optional argument for `kernel_truncation`.
            Defaults to 5.

        cost (string or function, optional): Optional argument for `kernel_truncation`.
            Defaults to None.

        extrapolate (function, optional): Function.
            If
            `f_ba` is a dual potential that is supported by the :math:`x_i`'s,
            `g_ab` is a dual potential that is supported by the :math:`y_j`'s,
            `eps` is the current value of the temperature :math:`\varepsilon`,
            `damping` is the current value of the damping coefficient for unbalanced OT,
            `C_xy` encodes the cost matrix :math:`C(x_i, y_j)` at the current
            ("coarse") resolution,
            `b_log` denotes the log-weights :math:`\log(\beta_j)`
            that are supported by the :math:`y_j`'s at the coarse resolution,
            and
            `C_xy_fine` encodes the cost matrix :math:`C(x_i, y_j)` at the next
            ("fine") resolution,
            then
            `extrapolate(f_ba, g_ab, eps, damping, C_xy, b_log, C_xy_fine)`
            will be used to compute the new values of the dual potential
            `f_ba` on the point cloud :math:`x_i` at a finer resolution.
            Defaults to None - it is not needed in single-scale mode.

        debias (bool, optional): Should we used the "de-biased" Sinkhorn divergence
            :math:`\text{S}_{\varepsilon, \rho}(\al,\be)` instead
            of the "raw" entropic OT cost
            :math:`\text{OT}_{\varepsilon, \rho}(\al,\be)`?
            This slows down the OT solver but guarantees that our approximation
            of the Wasserstein distance will be positive and definite
            - up to convergence of the Sinkhorn loop.
            For a detailed discussion of the influence of this parameter,
            see e.g. Fig. 3.21 in Jean Feydy's PhD thesis.
            Defaults to True.

        last_extrapolation (bool, optional): Should we perform a last, "full"
            Sinkhorn iteration before returning the dual potentials?
            This allows us to retrieve correct gradients without having
            to backpropagate trough the full Sinkhorn loop.
            Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        4-uple of Tensors: The four optimal dual potentials
            `(f_aa, g_bb, g_ab, f_ba)` that are respectively
            supported by the first, second, second and first input measures

        # of the input measures: this type of strategy is known as "multi-scale"
        # in computer graphics, "multi-grid" in numerical analysis,
        # "coarse-to-fine" in signal processing or "divide and conquer"
        # in standard complexity theory (e.g. for the quick-sort algorithm).
        #
        # In the Sinkhorn loop with epsilon-scaling annealing, our
        # representations of the input measures are fine enough to ensure
        # that the typical distance between any two samples x_i, y_j is always smaller
        # than the current value of "blur = eps**(1/p)".
        # As illustrated in Fig. 3.26 of Jean Feydy's PhD thesis, this allows us
        # to reach a satisfying level of precision while speeding up the computation
        # of the Sinkhorn iterations in the first few steps.
        #
        # In practice, different multi-scale representations of the input measures
